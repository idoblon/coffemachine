CoffeeMachine
Overview

This project simulates a simple Coffee Machine using Python. The program manages resources, processes user selections, handles payments, and dispenses drinks based on available ingredients.

The project is useful for practicing conditionals, loops, functions, dictionaries, and basic program flow.

Features

-Menu with multiple coffee options

-Resource management (water, milk, coffee, money)

-Coin-based payment handling

-Transaction validation and change return

-Ability to turn off the machine

-“Report” command to view current resources

Concepts Demonstrated

-Procedural programming

-Data structures (dict for menu/resources)

-Logical checks
